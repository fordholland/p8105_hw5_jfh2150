## Problem 1

Function to replace missing values in numeric and character vectors.

``` r
replace_na = function(x) {
  if (!(is.numeric(x) | is.character(x))) {
    stop("This function only supports numeric and character arguments.")
  } else if (is.numeric(x)) {
    x = replace(x, is.na(x), mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
      round(1)
    return(x)
  } else if (is.character(x)) {
    x = replace(x, is.na(x), "virginica")
    return(x)
  }
}
```

Apply this function to the columns of `iris_with_missing` using a `map`
statement.

``` r
iris_imputed = map_df(.x = iris_with_missing, ~replace_na(.x))
```

## Problem 2

This zip file contains data from a longitudinal study that included a
control arm and an experimental arm. Data for each participant is
included in a separate file, and file names include the subject ID and
arm.

Create a tidy dataframe containing data from all participants, including
the subject ID, arm, and observations over time:

  - Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files
    function will help
  - Iterate over file names and read in data for each subject using
    purrr::map and saving the result as a new variable in the dataframe
  - Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and
    subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any
    other tidying that’s necessary

<!-- end list -->

``` r
df = tibble(
  file = list.files("data")
) %>% 
  mutate(
    data = map(str_glue("data/{file}"), read_csv) %>% 
      map(pivot_longer, 
          week_1:week_8,
          names_to = "week", 
          values_to = "observation"),
    file = str_replace(file, "\\..*", "")
  ) %>% 
  rename(id = file)
```

Make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time,
and comment on differences between groups.

It seems the treatment received by the experiment arm caused a
noticeable increase in the observations. In fact, the control arm trends
downward slightly over time, while the treatment arm displays a
stronger, positive trend.

``` r
df %>% 
  unnest(cols = data) %>% 
  mutate(
    group = factor(str_detect(id, "con"), 
                   levels = c(TRUE, FALSE),
                   labels = c("control", "experimental")),
    week = str_replace(week, "week_", "")
    ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = observation, group = id, color = group)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Observations over time",
       x = "timepoint (weeks)",
       y = "observation",
       color = "study arm")
```

``` r
# brfss_smart2010 %>% 
#   filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
#   group_by(location_abbr, year) %>% 
#   mutate(data_value_avg = mean(data_value)) %>% 
#   select(year, location_abbr, data_value_avg) %>% 
#   ungroup() %>% 
#   ggplot(aes(x = year, y = data_value_avg)) +
#   geom_line(aes(group = location_abbr, color = location_abbr)) +
#   theme(legend.position = "none") +
#   labs(title = "Average BRFSS scores over time for all states",
#        x = "Year", 
#        y = "BRFSS score")
```
